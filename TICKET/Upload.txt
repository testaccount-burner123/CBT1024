The file tkt.cntl.xmi should be transferred to your z/OS system in BINARY mode using a target data set which is an 80-byte record length flat file. Blksize=0 can be used.

The following sequence might be used from a Windows platform using FTP


CD (folder where the TICKET files are stored)
FTP <IP address of your z/OS system>

    (userid and password prompts)

BIN
QUOTE SITE LRECL=80 BLKSIZE=0 RECFM=FB PRI=4 SEC=1 TRACKS
PUT TKT.CNTL.XMI



Once it is stored on your z/OS system (assumed to be under a high level qualifier of your userid) issue the following command,

RECEIVE INDA(TKT.CNTL.XMI)

This will produce the following prompts,

INMR901I Dataset LENNIE.TKT.CNTL from LENNIE on NODENAME 
INMR906A Enter restore parameters or 'DELETE' or 'END' + 

Just press enter at this point and you should receive the following messages showing the target dataset has been created,
